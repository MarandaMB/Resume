      <p>
        I love to do yoga in my free time. It is a wonderful break from sitting
        down in front of the computer physically and mentally.

      <p>
        I enjoy the process of cooking. It is almost theraputic. Cooking is
        always best when I follow the beat of my own drum and wing everything.
        No meausuring or rules to follow, just purely going with the flow.

      <h2><li>Walking</li></h2>
      <p>
        As simple a pleasure it may seem, I never pass up a good walk. I prefer
        a walk in nature to get some fresh air. However I also enjoy a nice walk
        in the city to explore new places.
